Shopify Backend Developer Challenge 2022:
This app was created in Visual Studio code, it runs using a node.js server running on the localhost:3000 port, and communicates with an NEDB database. 
In order to run this app you will need to install node.js, if you already have it installed it should work fine with whatever version you have.

This app includes the modules 'express' and 'nedb', these modules are included in this project and the user should not have to install them.
In the event an error does arrise involving these modules, the user can run the commands: 'npm install express' and 'npm install nedb' to resolve them,
this most likely won't happen though.

to run the app the user must start the server with the command 'node backend.js' while using either a command prompt, or the terminal in visual studio code.
note that you must be in the 'Shopify Challenge' Directory.
After the command is run you should be met with the message 'server listening at port:3000...Enter 'localhost:3000/Inventory_Manager.html' into your URL...'
once you enter this URL 'localhost:3000/Inventory_Manager.html' the app will be loaded in your web browser, from here you can view the already existing items in the database,
add new items, edit existing items, and delete existing items. The ids referred to in the forms are the ones shown in the Table, you can copy and paste them to save time.
